hello-world
===========

This my attempt at learning GitHub, Git, etc
I'm editing my README file now.  I'm going to go ahead and assume that this README speaks for itself.  I'll close the issue that some bozo raised about finishing it.

This is a branch of the original README file from the hello-world repository.

OK, so I suppose I'll say a little bit about myself.  I'm originally from Texas.  I have also lived in California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Washington.  I hold degrees in Philosophy, Finance, and Brewing.  I love problem-solving.
